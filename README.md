As you can tell by the name this program will fix Aero Peek in a very sloppy way. Normally in later Windows 10 versions(1903+)

Aero Peek will be broken unless there is a window maximized. 
This program creates a maximized window that is both invisible and click-through resulting in Aero Peek being fixed?

This is a very sloppy fix so if you can improve it please do.
